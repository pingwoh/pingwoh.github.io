                <p>Hi! My name is Katherine Byers, and I'm a Video Game Engineer. I studied <em>Art and Entertainment Technology</em> at the University of Texas at Austin, graduating in 2021 with Honors. I have been playing video games since I was 9 years old, sitting on the back of my grandfather's recliner while we tried to figure out various boss battle strategies together. As a result, I knew at a very young age what I wanted to do when I grew up - and here I am doing just that! I'm so incredibly proud of the work I've done in my career, and even back in college. I would love to talk more about my work as well as my journey in game development with y'all so please don't hesitate to reach out if you like what you see! [add headshot] [add buddy] </p>
